                <p>
                    And it came to pass that I, Nephi said unto my father: I will go and do the things which the Lord hath commanded,
                    for I know that the Lord giveth no commandments unto the children of men, save he shall prepare a way for them that
                    they may accomplish the thing which he commandeth them.

                    Yea, and are willing to mourn with those that mourn; yea, and comfort those that stand in need of comfort,
                    and to stand as witnesses of God at all times and in all things, and in all places that ye may be in,
                    even until death, that ye may be redeemed of God, and be numered with those of the first resurrection,
                    that ye may have eternal life.
